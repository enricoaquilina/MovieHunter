# PirateHunter

To run the simple script, you run the main.py file. The script was built using Python 3.4. The script goes to TPB and checks for the latest movies using several filters listed below. 

Filters:
1.	Checks that it's HD Quality
2.	At least 1 seeder(update in the future on this..)
3. 	Current year releases or last year
4. 	Check title for signs of languages other than English
6. 	Checks also that there are no other characters other than Roman ones such as Russian Cyrilic
5. 	Checks IMDB for the official language of the film
6.	Also checks that movie has not been downloaded yet


It then creates 2 new folders; ne for the current year releases and the other for the previous year and inserts the movie's title in it and orders alphabetically. Feel free to propose new changes to improve the project. Thanks.
